Staff scheduling is a challenging optimization task for organizations needing to allocate
employees while meeting diverse constraints such as required workforce coverage, maximum
consecutive workdays, rest periods, and special days like weekends. The objective is to
minimize the number of active employees while ensuring daily requirements are met.

To address these complexities, metaheuristic approaches like Teaching Learning Based
Optimization (TLBO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are
used for effective solutions
